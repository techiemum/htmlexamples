                    <p>Sami Yusuf is by no means your typical British celebrity: 
                       The Guardian named him “the biggest British star in the Middle East”, Time Magazine dubbed him “Islam’s Biggest Rockstar”, 
                       while the United Nations has appointed him a UN Global Ambassador Against Hunger and recognized him as a promoter of world peace and harmony.
